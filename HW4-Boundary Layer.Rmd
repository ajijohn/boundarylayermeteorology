Q3. Following measurement of mean winds and temperature were made from the 200m mast at Cabauw in The Netherlands on a September night.
```{r}
#meters
heightq3 <- c(5,10,20,40,80,120,160,200)
#wind speed (m/s)
windspeed3 <- c(2.2,2.7,3.5,5.4,8.2,9.1,8.7,7.8)
#wind direction (deg)
winddirection3 <- c(194,194,202,217,234,240,246,250)
#Temperature
temperature3 <- c(8.58,8.81,9.08,10.15,12.19,12.96,12.86,12.63)

length(heightq3)==length(windspeed3)
length(winddirection3)==length(temperature3)


```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
