This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for exploring temperature and humdity in boundary layer. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

5(a) - Show that the buoyant acceleration on a parcel of air in a thermally stratified environment is given by 

$$
a_b = -(g/T_v) (T_v-T_{vp})
$$
Answer:
$$

\text{Buyoancy (acceleration of air parcel)}
a_b = ((\rho - \rho_p)/\rho_p) * g\\
\\
\text{Density of the environment }\\
\rho = P/R* T_v  \\ 
\text{Density of the parcel }\\
\rho_p = P/R*T_{vp}\\
\\
\\
\text{Substitute}\\
a_b = (P/R*T_v - P/R*T_{vp})/(P/R*T_{vp})\\

a_b = ((P/R*T_v)/(P/R*T_{vp})) - (P/R*T_{vp})/(P/R*T_{vp})\\
a_b = (P/(R*Tv) * (R*T_{vp})/P ) - 1 \\
a_b = (R^2 * Tv * T_{vp}) - 1
